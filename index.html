        <p class="about_me"> My name is Daniel, I was born in Kirkland, Washington in October of 1987. When I was 21 I joined the Army to get funding for school in 2009. After being honorably discharged from the military in 2012 I began attending college courses at Edmonds Community College. I spent a couple years studying to become a chemical engineer before eventually returning to the job industry to work in telecommunications using the experience I obtained in the military. After a couple years of bouncing between telecommunications jobs I finally discovered CodeFellows and decided I wanted to use part of the remaining GI Bill benefits I have to begin a career in an industry which has always interested me. So here I am, learning to code.</p>
